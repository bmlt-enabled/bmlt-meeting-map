BMLT Tabbed UI implements a Tabbed UI for BMLT.

== Description ==

This plugin provides a GoogleMaps UI allowing users to find meetings stored in a the Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT) Server.
Simply put the shortcode [bmlt_meeting_map] into a Wordpress page and a map will be generated where nearby meetings are marked.
Click on a meeting location, and the details of all the meetings will pop up.  The display is responsive, suitible for mobile and
computers.  Panning (or zooming) in the map displays meeting there, or you may search for a different location using geocoding.
The meetings displayed may be filtered by a variety of criteria, such as format or language.  Additionally a text output of all
meetings currently in the viewport can be generated.

This plugin is appropriate for small and medium sized regions.  The meetings tracked should not exceed 500.
